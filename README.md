# SpringBootDemo

Hello! This is a project that I followed to get familiar with Spring Boot, a very popular Java framework.
In this project, I built an enterprise application integrated with a PostgreSQL Database.
I also was able to familiarize myself with concepts such as Restful API's, Dependency Injection, 
parsing JSON objects, POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE HTTP Requests. These are all very foundational ideas
that the Spring Boot framework relies on, so it was great to learn about how they interact with each other.

Thanks for reading!
